# Stachr, the mustache finder of your dreams

With so many options out there for finding a soulmate, we wanted to create a platform for men to show off their many upper lip furniture to other manly men. It is out of this need for testosterone validation that we have created Stachr. Stachr allows you to create a profile with your stash and be put out there for other people to vote on. You can also swipe through the current user-base and vote on the flavor savor that most tickles your fancy. Stachr is an on-going project and has had its development halted for the time being.
